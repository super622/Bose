üöÄ Introducing ‚ú® Bose Framework - The Swiss Army Knife for Bot Developers ü§ñ
=============================================================================

Bot Development is Tough.

Bot Detectors like Cloudflare are ready to defend websites from our
Bots. Configuring Selenium with ChromeOptions to specify the driver
path, profile, user agent, and window size is Cumbersome and a nightmare
in windows. Debugging Bot Crashes via logs is hard. How do you solve
these pain points without sacrificing speed and handy development?

Enter Bose. Bose is the first bot development framework in the Developer
Community that is specifically designed to provide the best developer
experience for bot developers. Powered by Selenium, it offers a range of
features and functionalities to simplify the process of bot development.
As far as our knowledge goes, Bose is the first bot development
framework of its kind in the town.

Getting Started
---------------

Clone Starter Template

::

   git clone https://github.com/omkarcloud/bose-starter my-bose-project

Then change into that directory, install dependencies, and start the
project:

::

   cd my-bose-project
   python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
   python main.py

The first run will take some time as it downloads the chrome driver
executable, subsequent runs will be fast.

Core features
-------------

1. Adds Powerful Methods to make working with Selenium a lot easier.
2. Follows best practices to avoid Bot Detection by Cloudflare and
   PerimeterX.
3. Saves the HTML, Screenshot, and the run details for each task run to
   enable easy debugging.
4. Utility components to write scraped data as JSON, CSV, and Excel
   files.
5. Automatically downloads and initializes the correct Chrome driver.
6. Fast and Developer friendly.

Usage
-----

Say you want to start scraping a website. If you were using bare
Selenium, you would have to handle the imperative tasks of opening and
closing the driver like this:

.. code:: python

   from selenium import webdriver

   driver_path = 'path/to/chromedriver'

   driver = webdriver.Chrome(executable_path=driver_path)

   driver.get('https://www.example.com')

   driver.quit()

However, with Bose Framework, you can take a declarative and structured
approach. You only need to write the following code, and Bose driver
will take care of creating the driver, passing it to the **``run``**
method of the Task, and closing the driver:

.. code:: python

   from bose import *
           
   class Task(BaseTask):
       def run(self, driver):
           driver.get('https://www.example.com')

Configuration
-------------

In bare Selenium, if you want to configure options such as the profile,
user agent, or window size, it requires writing a lot of code, as shown
below:

.. code:: python

   from selenium.webdriver.chrome.options import Options
   from selenium import webdriver

   driver_path = 'path/to/chromedriver.exe'

   options = Options()

   profile_path = '1'

   options.add_argument(f'--user-data-dir={profile_path}')

   user_agent = 'Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/106.0.0.0 Safari/537.37")'
   options.add_argument(f'--user-agent={user_agent}')

   window_width = 1200
   window_height = 720
   options.add_argument(f'--window-size={window_width},{window_height}')

   driver = webdriver.Chrome(executable_path=driver_path, options=options)

On the other hand, Bose Framework simplifies these complexities by
encapsulating the browser configuration within the **``BrowserConfig``**
property of the Task, as shown below:

.. code:: python

   from bose import BaseTask, BrowserConfig, UserAgent, WindowSize

   class Task(BaseTask):
       browser_config = BrowserConfig(user_agent=UserAgent.user_agent_106, window_size=WindowSize.window_size_1280_720, profile=1)

Exception handling
------------------

Exceptions are common when using Selenium. In bare Selenium, if an
exception occurs, the driver automatically closes, leaving you with only
logs to debug.

In Bose, when an exception occurs in a scraping task, the browser
remains open instead of immediately closing. This allows you to see the
live browser state at the moment the exception occurred, which greatly
helps in debugging.

Debugging
---------

Web scraping can often be fraught with errors, such as incorrect
selectors or pages that fail to load. When debugging with raw Selenium,
you may have to sift through logs to identify the issue. Fortunately,
Bose makes it simple for you to debug by storing information about each
run.

After each run a directory is created in tasks which contains three
files, which are listed below:

``task_info.json``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

It contains information about the task run such as duration for which
the task run, the ip details of task, the user agent, window_size and
profile which used to execute the task.

.. figure:: https://www.omkar.cloud/bose/assets/images/task-info-1ad8d89552138e2edc900434144dfbe0.png

``final.png``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This is the screenshot captured before driver was closed.

.. figure:: https://www.omkar.cloud/bose/assets/images/final-d2ca24d2717d17576eb8233ad0cd2b10.png

``page.html``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This is the html source captured before driver was closed. Very useful
to know in case your selectors failed to select elements.

.. figure:: https://www.omkar.cloud/bose/assets/images/page-cffce10976b4bf201b49a479c2340075.png

``error.log``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In case your task crashed due to exception we also store error.log which
contains the error due to which the task crashed. This is very helful in
debugging.

Outputting Data
---------------

After performing web scraping, we need to store the data in either JSON
or CSV format. Typically, this process involves writing a significant
amount of imperative code which looks like this:

.. code:: python

   import csv
   import json

   def write_json(data, filename):
       with open(filename, 'w') as fp:
           json.dump(data, fp, indent=4)

   def write_csv(data, filename):
       with open(filename, 'w', newline='', encoding='utf-8') as csvfile:
           fieldnames = data[0].keys()  # get the fieldnames from the first dictionary
           writer = csv.DictWriter(csvfile, fieldnames=fieldnames)
           writer.writeheader()  # write the header row
           writer.writerows(data)  # write each row of data

   data = [
       {
           "text": "\u201cThe world as we have created it is a process of our thinking. It cannot be changed without changing our thinking.\u201d",
           "author": "Albert Einstein"
       },
       {
           "text": "\u201cIt is our choices, Harry, that show what we truly are, far more than our abilities.\u201d",
           "author": "J.K. Rowling"
       }
   ]

   write_json(data, "data.json")
   write_csv(data, "data.csv")

Bose simplifies these complexities by encapsulating them in Output
Module for reading and writing Data.

To use Output Method, call the¬†``write``¬†method for the type of file you
want to save.

All data will be saved in the¬†``output/``¬†folder:

See following Code for Reference

.. code:: python

   from bose import Output

   data = [
       {
           "text": "\u201cThe world as we have created it is a process of our thinking. It cannot be changed without changing our thinking.\u201d",
           "author": "Albert Einstein"
       },
       {
           "text": "\u201cIt is our choices, Harry, that show what we truly are, far more than our abilities.\u201d",
           "author": "J.K. Rowling"
       }
   ]

   Output.write_json(data, "data.json")
   Output.write_csv(data, "data.csv")

Undetected Driver
-----------------

`Ultrafunkamsterdam <https://github.com/ultrafunkamsterdam>`__¬†created
a¬†`ChromeDriver <https://github.com/ultrafunkamsterdam/undetected-chromedriver>`__¬†that
has excellent support for bypassing **all major bot detection
systems**¬†such as Distil, Datadome, Cloudflare, and others.

Bose recognized the importance of bypassing bot detections and provides
in built support for
`Ultrafunkamsterdam‚Äôs <https://github.com/ultrafunkamsterdam>`__
`Undetected
Driver <https://github.com/ultrafunkamsterdam/undetected-chromedriver>`__

Using the Undetected Driver in Bose Framework is as simple as passing
the **``use_undetected_driver``** option to the **``BrowserConfig``**,
like so:

.. code:: python

   from bose import BaseTask, BrowserConfig

   class Task(BaseTask):
       browser_config = BrowserConfig(use_undetected_driver=True)

LocalStorage
------------

Just like how modern browsers have a local storage module, Bose has also
incorporated the same concept in its framework.

You can import the LocalStorage object from Bose to persist data across
browser runs, which is extremely useful when scraping large amounts of
data.

The data is stored in a file named¬†``local_storage.json``¬†in the root
directory of your project. Here‚Äôs how you can use it:

.. code:: python

   from bose import LocalStorage

   LocalStorage.set_item("pages", 5)
   print(LocalStorage.get_item("pages"))
