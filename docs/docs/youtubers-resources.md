# YouTube Resources

We greatly appreciate it when YouTubers create videos about Bose.

In this section, you will find ideas to assist you in creating engaging content.

## Content Ideas

Here are some nice ideas that we are confident your audience will enjoy:

- Develop a YouTube bot that explores 500 developer YouTube channels, extracting popular videos from each one and determining the top-ranking video types. You can even leverage this data to create your own popular videos. ðŸ˜Ž
- Build a GitHub bot that generates leads by extracting email addresses of users who have starred a repository.
- Create a LinkedIn bot to reach out to individuals who are likely to be interested in your video.
- Generate leads using Google Maps Scraper.
- Create 100 Outlook accounts.

If you have a great video idea, we encourage you to create a GitHub discussion [here](https://github.com/omkarcloud/bose/discussions) to discuss it.

We will provide you with content guidance, code assistance, and idea validation to bring your ideas to life. ðŸŒ±

## Tutorial Code Assistance

We would be happy to provide you with easy-to-read code for your specific tutorial. This will cut your video production time in half.

If you are interested in us writing code for your tutorial, please create a GitHub discussion [here](https://github.com/omkarcloud/bose/discussions) to discuss it.

## Promotional Opportunities

We can help you promote your videos by adding them to our [Learning and Useful Treasures](learning-and-useful-treasures.md) section.

This section gets thousands of hits and will be an evergreen source of views for your channel.
