# Ethics

In the Mahabharata, there is a dialogue between Yudhishthira and Yamaraja (the God of Death) in which Yudhishthira says that, "Dharma Samrakshate Rakshitah," which translates to "Dharma protects those who protect it." 

In other words, those who protect Dharma are protected by the divine forces of the universe.

Now, let's learn about the ethical guidelines that bot developers should follow at all times:

1. Do not propagate hate speech or spread false information about individuals or communities.

* Real-world example: Do not create bots to send posts in a group with the intention of promoting hatred against a person or community.

2. Do not scrape content that is used to harm people, such as pornography, the Dark Web, or drugs.

* Real-world example: Do not create bots that scrape data related to pornography, the Dark Web, or drugs, as such content is used to harm people.

3. Do not harm people mentally.

* Real-world example: Do not create bots to send abusive messages to specific individuals.

4. Do not harm businesses financially.

* Real-world example: Do not create bots that create accounts to mine cryptocurrencies on cloud platforms, as this can lead to significant financial losses for the cloud company.

The guiding principle of these ethics is simple: "Feel free to use your bots to do whatever you want, just don't harm someone."
