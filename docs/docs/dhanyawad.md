The Bose Web Scraping Framework is dedicated to Subhash Chandra Bose.

:::

We dedicate this project to Subhash Chandra Bose, the person who turbo boosted Bharat's freedom. Subhash Chandra Bose was the founder of Azad Hind Fauj (Indian National Army),which was formed from Indian prisoners of war captured by the Axis powers (Germany, Japan, and Italy) during World War II. The Azad Hind Fauj fought against the British Indian Army to free Bharat from British rule in present day Mynammar.

Although the Azad Hind Fauj was unsuccessful in defeating the British Indian Army, taking up arms against the British had a domino effect on Indians in the police and British Indian Army. They revolted and started fighting against the Britishers, forcing them to leave Bharat in 1947.

Without Subhash Chandra Bose's efforts, Bharat may have had to wait for few more decades to gain independence. Consequently, Internet would had arrived late in Bharat and, I wouldn't have been able to learn programming and create this framework to help you.

Therefore, we are grateful to Netaji for his role in turbo boosting Bharat's freedom movement. Jai Hind.

## Thanks 

Bose framework stands on the shoulders of giants. We leverage various projects to simplify web scraping for you. We extend our gratitude to the following individuals who have developed the software that Bose framework relies on:

-   Jason Huggins, the creator of the Selenium library, which is the backbone of Bose framework. Thank you, Jason, for creating Selenium.
-   Leon, who developed the undetected-chromedriver library, which we utilize to avoid detection by anti-bot detection services such as Cloudflare. Thank you, Leon.
-   Chida, who developed the chromedriver-autoinstaller library, which we employ to download the driver for your Chrome version that is utilized to launch the browser. Thank you, Chida.
-   Kenneth Reitz, who developed the requests library, which is used in Bose framework. Thank you, Kenneth Reitz, for creating requests.

## Responsible Usage

The Bose Framework is made to help humanity. So please uphold dharma and remember thee golden words.
