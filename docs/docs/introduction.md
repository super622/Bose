description: Bose is the Ultimate Web Scraping Framework
---

# Introduction

The Bose Scraping Framework is a full fledged scraping framework designed to simplify website scraping and automation using [Selenium](https://www.selenium.dev/). Think of it like Django for Web Automation. 

It comes equipped with several features, including:

- Pre-built web scraping solutions for sites like Google Maps, which means you won't have to do any additional work to scrape them
- Great debugging features to help you troubleshoot any issues that may arise
- Automatic adherence to best practices to avoid detection from anti-bot services like Cloudflare
- User agent rotation to ensure that you don't get blocked for using the same agent repeatedly
- Logging of HTML, errors, and screenshots to facilitate debugging
- Support retrying in case of failures
- Detection of bot detection by anti-bot services like Cloudflare, PerimeterX, and DataDome

## Getting the Most out of Bose

To get the most out of Bose, you should read the [Tutorial](tutorial/tutorial.md).

The tutorial is the best way to start your Bose adventure. It's readable and feature-ful. You'll go all the way from `git clone` to scraping Google Maps! And by the end, you should feel comfortable enough to scrape websites using Bose framework.

After you've read the tutorial and started your side project, We encourage you to read the Topics from Reference which interests you. 

Additionally, We warmly welcome you to Bose Community!

## How these Docs are Organized

As you can probably tell from the sidebar, Bose's docs are organized into two sections:

- [Tutorial](tutorial/tutorial.md)
- [Reference](/docs/category/reference/)
<!-- - [How To](/docs/category/how-to/) -->

The order isn't arbitrary. This is more or less the learning journey we have in mind for you.

While we expect you to read the tutorial from top to bottom (maybe even more than once?), we of course don't expect you to read the Reference To sections that way. The content in those sections is there on an as-needed basis. 

That said, there are some references you should consider reading at some point in your Bose learning journey. Especially if you want to become an advanced user. It's worth getting to know them inside and out.
