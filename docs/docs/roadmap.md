# Roadmap

Below is the roadmap we envision for the Bose Framework:

- Reach out to YouTubers/Bloggers to promote Bose.
- Implement Captcha Solving directly within the Bose Framework.
- Integrate built-in IP rotation functionality to handle requests effectively.
- Enhance the framework to support purchasing temporary emails.

<!-- Parallel Run + Proxy HAHA?  -->
<!-- Add support for playright, requests, parallel haha?  -->
We are also considering the following options:

- Explore the possibility of purchasing a large number of pre-created Google and Microsoft accounts.
- Integrate Kubernetes and provide utilities to enable data scraping at Google's scale.
- Feature bots created by the community.
- Enable the community to sell their scraped datasets.
- Add support for popular bots such as Facebook, Instagram, and TikTok scrapers.
- Enhance the versatility of profile pictures generated by the Account Generation module by incorporating a vast collection of AI-generated images.

<!-- IDEAS
Account Generator will by default give based on the country of the requestor.
