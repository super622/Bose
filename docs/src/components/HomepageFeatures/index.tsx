          <p>We dedicate this project to Subhash Chandra Bose, the
            person who turbo boosted Bharat&#x27;s freedom. Subhash Chandra Bose was the founder of Azad Hind Fauj
            (Indian National Army),which was formed from Indian prisoners of war captured by the Axis powers
            (Germany, Japan, and Italy) during World War II. The Azad Hind Fauj fought against the British Indian
            Army to free Bharat from British rule in present day Mynammar.</p>
          <p>Although the Azad Hind Fauj was unsuccessful in
            defeating the British Indian Army, taking up arms against the British had a domino effect on Indians in
            the police and British Indian Army. They revolted and started fighting against the Britishers, forcing
            them to leave Bharat in 1947.</p>
          <p>Without Subhash Chandra Bose&#x27;s efforts, Bharat may
            have had to wait for few more decades to gain independence. Consequently, Internet would had
            arrived late in Bharat and, I wouldn&#x27;t have been able to learn programming and create this framework to
            help you.</p>
          <p>Therefore, we are grateful to Netaji for his role in
            turbo boosting Bharat&#x27;s freedom movement. Jai Hind.</p>
